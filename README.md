# Dash-Me-Cat
Another Endless-Runner kinda game, made with Unity3D.  

# Featuring  
- All of the gameobjects(projectiles, obstacles etc) were made to be reusable.
- No code bloats (hopefully).  
- No Instantating + destroying on runtime. None.. Nada... Zero!
- Everything was cached!

# To Do!
Remove URP! Bloom is expensive on mobiles! (Unity has lied to us!)

# Requirements:
Universal Render Pipeline (v10.4.0 or later)  

# Copyright
You can't use all the assets such as; images and musics. Those copyright are belong to me and the original game that this project was meant to be made. Anything than that, feel free to use it as your base project to make something else if you want. 
   
# NOTE:
Do not sell this project as a whole package in Assets Store. If you do, I'll show up under your bed!
